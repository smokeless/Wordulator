Wordulator is my project for messing with strings in Python 3.

Right now I'm laying down baseline functions and letting it develop.
I intend to use it as a personal library, and maybe tack on a gui front-end
for getting information on stuff.

Current functions:
sanitize: clean a string up to words with spaces, or without.
letter_count: how many letters in a string.
special_char_count: how many special chars in a string.
vowel_count: how many vowels in string, including y
to_number_leet: convert string to numbered leet speak
random_case: change letters to random case
reverse_string: reverse the string
remove_vowels: strip all vowels from string, including y
